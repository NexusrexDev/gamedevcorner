# Nexusrex's Gamedev Corner
This Github Pages site is a quick attempt to use Jekyll as well as a platform to post thoughts, analysis and blog-styled posts about anything gamedev I do.

## Credits
[Nicholas Vanhoren's](https://github.com/nicolas-van) guides were extremely useful: [Bootstrap-4-Github-Pages](https://github.com/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages) and [Easy-Markdown-to-Github-Pages](https://github.com/nicolas-van/easy-markdown-to-github-pages).
The theme was built upon Bootswatch's [Darkly](https://bootswatch.com/darkly/).
